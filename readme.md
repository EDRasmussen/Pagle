# Pagle
Pagle is a fishing bot for World of Warcraft 2.4.3 (8606).

To toggle pause, press F12.

## Injector
The DLL injector included is a very simple injector. You should not use this for anything other than this bot, as it is likely to trigger a ban for other games or versions of World of Warcraft.

## Why is it not working for me?
This fishing bot was created to work on Karazhan (Atlantiss). They have an anti cheating measure which fakes the bobbing in the start of the fishing cast. If you are playing on a server which does not do this, please see Pagle/Pagle.cpp.
